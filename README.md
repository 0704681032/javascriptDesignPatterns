  <b>Abstract Factory</b>	  Creates an instance of several families of classes<br>
  <b>Builder</b>	  Separates object construction from its representation<br>
  <b>Factory Method</b>	  Creates an instance of several derived classes<br>
  <b>Prototype</b>	  A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned<br>
  <b>Singleton</b>	  A class of which only a single instance can exist<br>

  <b>Structural Patterns</b><br><br>
  <b>Adapter</b>	  Match interfaces of different classes<br>
  <b>Bridge</b>	  Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation<br>
  <b>Composite</b>	  A tree structure of simple and composite objects<br>
  <bDecorator></b>	  Add responsibilities to objects dynamically<br>
  <b>Facade</b>	  A single class that represents an entire subsystem<br>
